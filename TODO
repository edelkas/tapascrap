Additional things to scrap from threads:

* Pins.
* Locked.
* Other similar properties?

Additional things to scrap from posts:

* Parse QUOTES properly.
* Attachments (event if they don't exist, have a note).
* Likes?
* More?

Additional things to scrap from forums:

* It's important to obtain the forum hierarchy tree, so we know which forums are
  subforums to which forums. For this, it's enough to know which is the parent
  of each forum, being the "root" the parent of the top level forums.
* Moderators for each forum.

Other things to scrap:

* Member list, or at least, count. This way we could make sure that once the
  scrap finishes, we have them all.
* Same for total threads, total posts, as well as posts from each user.
  That way we can compare our scrap with the online stats to see if
  it's complete or not.
* Same for other possible stats.
