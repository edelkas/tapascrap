* No need to re-scrap page 1 after "parse_thread".
* Add more security measures:
  - Add rescues all around.
  - Maybe modify some of the parsing strategies to be more consistent
    (ie. use parent.at instead of next or children[n]).

Additional things to scrap from users:

* Profile image.

Additional things to scrap from threads:

* Pins.
* Locked.
* Polls.
* Announcements.
* Other similar properties?

Additional things to scrap from posts:

* Polls (options, votes, ...)
* Last edit date, number of edits.
* Parse QUOTES properly.
* Attachments (event if they don't exist, have a note).
* Likes?
* More?

Additional things to scrap from forums:

* Moderators for each forum.

Other things to scrap:

* Member list, or at least, count. This way we could make sure that once the
  scrap finishes, we have them all.
* Same for total threads, total posts, as well as posts from each user.
  That way we can compare our scrap with the online stats to see if
  it's complete or not.
* Same for other possible stats.
